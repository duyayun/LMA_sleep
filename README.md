Abstract of our paper: Accurate identification of sleep stages and disorders is crucial for maintaining health,
preventing chronic conditions, and improving diagnosis and treatment. Direct respiratory
measurements, key biomarkers, are missing in traditional wrist- or finger-worn wearables,
which thus limit their precision in detection of sleep stages and sleep disorders. By contrast,
this work introduces a simple, multimodal, skin-integrated, energy-efficient mechano-acoustic
sensor capable of synchronized cardiac and respiratory measurements. The mechanical
design enhances sensitivity and durability, enabling continuous, wireless monitoring of
essential vital signs (respiration rate, heart rate and corresponding variability, temperature)
and various physical activities. Systematic physiology-based analytics involving explainable
artificial intelligence allows both precise sleep characterization and transparent tracking of
each factorâ€™s contribution, demonstrating the dominance of respiration, as validated through
a diverse range of human subjects, both healthy and with sleep disorders. This methodology
enables cost-effective, clinical-quality sleep tracking with minimal user effort, suitable for
home and clinical use.
